One fundamental question all retail business always ask: how much inventory should I carry? In one hand to mush inventory means working capital costs, operational costs and a complex operation. On the other hand lack of inventory leads to lost sales, unhappy customers and a damaged brand. Current inventory management models have many solutions to place the correct order, but they are all based in a single unknown factor: the demand for the next periods. This is why short-term forecasting is so important in retail and consumer goods industry.

i would create a demand forecasting model for the next 4-8 weeks and also trends in the previous sales. This valuable insight can help many supply chain practitioners to correctly manage their inventory levels

This data was gotten from Kaggle. The link would be place in the code.
